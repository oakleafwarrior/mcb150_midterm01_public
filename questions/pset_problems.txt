================================


========================================
PROBLEM SET 1 (Due: Jan. 29 at 5pm)
========================================

1. List three differences between the innate and adaptive immune systems in terms of
   microbial recognition.

2. Predict the outcome of Jenner's famous "experiment" if he had changed it in the
   following ways. Provide a brief explanation of your answer.
   A. He waited 2 days between the first injection of fluid from the cowpox pustule
      and the second injection of fluid for the smallpox pustule.
   B. The first injection consisted of SARS-CoV-2 instead of fluid from the cowpox
      pustule.
   C. He used purified proteins from cowpox virus for the first injection.

3. What is the mechanism through which beta-Defensins exert anti-microbial activity?
   How is this activity regulated?

4. Describe three ways that the cleavage of C3 facilitates clearance of a bacterial
   infection.

5. Predict the relative severity of disorders associated with deficiency in the following
   components of complement. Justify why one disorder may be more or less severe
   than another.
   A. C9
   B. C5
   C. Factor D

6. Why might a patient with Factor H deficiency develop severe swelling?


========================================
PROBLEM SET 2 (Due: Feb. 5 at 5pm)
========================================

1. Predict which pattern recognition receptor(s) is (are) likely to be important for the
   sensing of the following microbes.
   a) E. coli (a gram-negative bacterium that replicates extracellularly)
   b) Influenza (a single-stranded RNA virus)
   c) Listeria (a gram-positive bacterium that escapes from phagosomes)
   d) Herpes simplex virus 1 (a DNA virus)

2. TRIF is an adaptor in TLR signaling that leads to IRF3 activation, yet mice lacking
   IRF3 are more susceptible to many viral infections than mice lacking TRIF. Explain.

[Note: Question 3 is not present in the template PDF.]

4. One of the common measures that clinicians use to assess a patient who they
   suspect may have an infection is levels of C Reactive Protein in their blood. Why?

5. For each of the following cytokines, describe the pathway they use to induce
   expression of genes in target cells. Include the type of receptor, key signaling
   steps, and transcription factor(s) used.
   a) IL-1beta
   b) IL-6
   c) TNF-alpha
   d) IL-12

6. You are performing experiments with dendritic cells isolated from TLR2+/-
   (heterozygote) or TLR2-/- (knockout) mice. You analyze a few different parameters
   after stimulating the cells with lipopeptides (a ligand for TLR2/1).
   Draw the expected results for the following western blot for IkBa on lysates of
   stimulated dendritic cells with the indicated genotype (TLR2+/- vs TLR2-/-).

7. You are tasked with developing a monoclonal antibody drug for the treatment of
   Sepsis (septic shock). Based on what you've learned so far in MCB 150, specify 2
   potential target antigens for such an antibody, and describe how and why targeting
   these proteins with an antibody might work to protect against sepsis.


========================================
PROBLEM SET 3 (Due: Feb. 12 at 5pm)
========================================

1. Draw schematics of an antibody and a TCR, labeling the chains, antigen binding
   regions, Fc domain, and CDRs.

2. Explain why a Fab fragment from an antibody specific for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
   may prevent infection of cells but doesn't promote phagocytosis of the virus.

3. The cells in a lymph node are a mixture of T cells (~50% of total), B cells (~40%),
   and dendritic cells and macrophages (~10%). B220 is a surface protein expressed
   by all B cells. There are about twice as many CD4 T cells as CD8 T cells.
   a) Based on these approximations, draw the 2-parameter flow cytometry plots of
      lymph node cells stained with antibodies specific for the indicated proteins.
      Include the percentage of cells in each quadrant.
      Plots: B220 vs TCR | CD4 vs CD8 | CD4 vs TCR

4. Imagine that you have purified populations of B and T cells specific for the
   SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. You want to study how these cells respond to antigen.
   When you culture the cells with virus (plus some dendritic cells) you see that both
   the B and T cells get activated and proliferate. However, when you perform the same
   experiment but first treat the virus with a cocktail of proteases, only the T cells get
   activated and proliferate. How can you explain this difference? What does this tell
   you about the spike-specific B cells that you isolated?

5. a) Draw the 2-parameter flow cytometry plot of lymph node cells from a wild-type
      mouse stained with antibodies specific for the indicated proteins. Include the
      percentage of cells in each quadrant. (B220 is a surface protein expressed by B cells.)
      Plots: B220 vs TCR | B220 vs MHC II

   b) Assuming that successful generation of a BCR or TCR is required for B cells and
      T cells to exit the bone marrow or thymus, respectively, draw the 2-parameter flow
      cytometry plot of lymph node cells from a RAG1-deficient mouse stained with
      antibodies specific for the indicated proteins. Include the percentage of cells in
      each quadrant.
      Plots: B220 vs TCR | B220 vs MHC II

6. Predict the relative severity of immune dysfunction in humans with the following
   mutations. Briefly explain your reasoning.
   a) Inactivating mutations in RAG-2
   b) Inactivating mutations in DNA-PK
   c) Deletion of the 6 JH segments in the IgH locus


========================================
PROBLEM SET 4 (Due: Feb. 19 at 5pm)
========================================

1. Describe three important differences between class I and class II MHC proteins.

2. Define the following terms:
   a) inbred strain
   b) congenic strain
   c) haplotype
   d) HLA

3. You have two different inbred strains of mice, strain A and strain B. You mate a
   strain A mouse to a strain B mouse, producing F1 progeny.
   a) Will the F1 mice accept a skin graft from the strain A parent mouse? Why or
      why not?
   b) Will the strain B parent mouse accept a skin graft from an F1 mouse? Why or
      why not?

4. A mouse of inbred strain A is immunized with antigen X and T cells are purified a
   week later. These T cells are mixed in vitro with antigen and macrophages from the
   indicated strains of mice. Would you predict that the T cells would proliferate in
   each case? Why? (Assume inbred strains A and B have different MHC haplotypes.)

   T cells   | Antigen | Macrophage                  | Proliferation?
   --------- | ------- | --------------------------- | ---------------
   a) Strain A | yes   | Strain A                    | ++++
   b) Strain A | yes   | none                        | ?
   c) Strain A | no    | Strain A                    | ?
   d) Strain A | yes   | Strain B                    | ?
   e) Strain A | yes   | F1 hybrid of Strain A x B   | ?

   f) When T cells from an immunized Strain A mouse are mixed with antigen and
      macrophages from a Strain C mouse, the T cells proliferate as well as when
      stimulated with macrophages from a Strain A mouse. Explain.

   g) T cells from an unimmunized Strain A mouse proliferate when mixed with
      macrophages from a Strain B mouse (not as much proliferation as in (a), but
      significant proliferation: "+" vs "++++"). Explain.

5. What is meant by the statement that MHC alleles are "co-dominantly" expressed?

6. The following set of peptides are eluted from a purified MHC molecule:
      VFTSKAINK
      SFTIRTALK
      QFTYFIVAK
      RFTQKAIAK
      RFTQFIVNK
      EFTGKYFKK
   a) Which class of MHC molecule are the peptides from?
   b) Circle the anchor residues in each peptide.

7. MHC Class II molecules will traffic through the same ER that MHC Class I molecules
   are in, yet they do not normally bind the same peptides as MHC Class I.
   a) What mechanism prevents MHC Class II from binding peptides in the ER?
   b) How is this mechanism overcome such that MHC Class II is eventually loaded
      with peptides?

8. Draw flow cytometry plots of what you would expect from the following scenarios.
   The cells in a lymph node are a mixture of T cells (~50% of total), B cells (~40%),
   and dendritic cells and macrophages (~10%). There are about twice as many CD4
   T cells as CD8 T cells.
   a) Two parameter flow cytometry plot of lymph node cells from a wildtype mouse
      stained with antibodies specific for H2-A and TCR.
   b) Two parameter flow cytometry plot of lymph node cells from a wildtype mouse
      stained with antibodies specific for H2-K and TCR.
   c) Two parameter flow cytometry plot of lymph node cells from a beta-2M deficient
      mouse stained with antibodies specific for H2-K and TCR.

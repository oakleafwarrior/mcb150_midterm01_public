2. Describe the four core tasks that the immune system must accomplish to
   successfully defend the host against infection. For each task, give one
   specific example of a cell type or molecule that carries it out.

      booster? Why?
   b) What is the name of this phenomenon?
   c) Identify the specific molecular event on the dendritic cell that links

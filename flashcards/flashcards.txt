Q: TCR Gamma Chain / Delta Chain
A: Alternative TCR chains forming the gamma-delta TCR; expressed by a minor T cell subset with distinct tissue distribution and antigen recognition properties.

Q: Endosomal/Lysosomal Pathway (MHC II)
A: Extracellular antigens are taken up by endocytosis/phagocytosis, degraded by proteases at low pH in endosomes/lysosomes, and peptides are loaded onto MHC class II for presentation to CD4+ T cells.

Q: Invariant Chain (Ii / CD74)
A: A chaperone that binds to newly assembled MHC class II heterodimers in the ER; the CLIP segment blocks the peptide-binding groove, and Ii's cytoplasmic tail directs MHC II trafficking through the Golgi to endosomes.

Q: CLIP (Class II-associated Invariant chain Peptide)

Q: Cross-presentation
A: The process by which dendritic cells (primarily cDC1s) present exogenously acquired (endocytosed) antigens on MHC class I molecules to prime CD8+ T cells; allows immune responses against pathogens that do not directly infect dendritic cells.
